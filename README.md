Specification and examples for IPTC's Video Metadata Hub

## Specification (aka Recommendation)

In the `specification` folder we have the HTML files used on
https://iptc.org/std/videometadatahub/recommendation/ plus scripts used
to generate them from a set of Google Docs worksheets used internally by the
IPTC Video Metadata Working Group.

## Example files

In the `examples` folder, we provide some small video files with embedded IPTC
Video Metadata Hub properties added using various formats.
